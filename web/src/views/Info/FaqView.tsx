        <Q q="Where is my data stored?">
          Beholden stores campaigns locally on your machine. You can back up by copying your campaign files.
        </Q>

        <Q q="Is this a VTT or a rules engine?">
          Neither... Beholden is a campaign tracker + combat helper. It does not try to enforce rules or replace your table.
        </Q>

        <Q q="Can I import monsters?">
          Yep! the compendium supports importing monster data. If you’re missing a creature or a stat looks off,
          you can update the compendium and refresh.
        </Q>

        <Q q="Does Beholden sync to the cloud?">
          Not by default. It’s designed to work offline first. If you want sync, use a folder sync tool (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
          on the data directory.
        </Q>

        <Q q="Why make this?">
          Because I used to use a great app called Game Master 5e, but it stopped working and the developer disappeared. I wanted a free tool that did the same but with a better Combat Difficulty meter.
        </Q>

        <Q q="Can my players...?">
          No. This is DM Facing. This is for a table where the DM has a laptop or tablet open to manage combat and NPCs, while players use their own character sheets and dice. I think when players have access to the same tool, it can pull focus away from the game and onto the app. I want Beholden to stay out of the way and let you focus on the game.
        </Q>

        <Q q="When do updates come out?">
          When I have time, and feel the app needs more. You can see my future endeavours on the updates page. I’m a solo indie dev with a dayjob, so updates come when they come. If you want to see something sooner, feel free to fork it on GitHub and submit a PR, or buy me a pizza to speed things up. 🍕
        </Q>

        <Q q="Why should I support you?">
          You don't have to. The code is at your disposal, feel free to remove the button. It's in ShellLayout.tsx. I won't lose sleep over it. I use this app myself, and I'll keep improving it whether people support me or not. 
          But if you want to give me the fuzzies and help me feel validated, I'd appreciate it.
        </Q>

        <Q q="I have a great idea!">
          That's not a question. I'm open to collaborating with people. If you have an idea for a feature or improvement, feel free to reach out on GitHub. I can't promise I'll implement every suggestion, but I'm always happy to hear feedback and consider new ideas. Or just fork it!
